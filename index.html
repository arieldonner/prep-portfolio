        <p>While I have been consistently learning and practicing programming, I actually come from a job in education. For the
        last 3 years, I had been a Math and STEM teacher and it was through teaching that I became introduced to programming. As
        a part of STEM, students were to learn how to code in Python. I had never really been exposed to programming before I
        had to learn enough to be able to teach my students.</p>
        <p>It was this that sparked my drive to learn more about programming.
        I loved the inherent logical and mathematical aspects of programming languages while also being able to be creative in
        what you could do with it and the ways that you can solve problems. I started my individual learning journey with C# and
        have currently been studying web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
